Research and Detection of Multi-modal Fake News in the Background of the Digital Divide -  A Text and Social Feature Fusion Model based on BERT 

Initialized our model with the parameters of bert-base-chinese model and connected Dense layer to BERT; fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks using public Chinese dataset and output classification results to achieve better classification capabilities
Developed specialized vocabulary libraries for various domains and performed tokenization 
Formed BERT dual-text input by linking news text features and social text features, and detected fake news concerning its explosive spread and high repetition of ghostwriters’ usernames
Tested on the dataset released by Tsinghua University and obtained 0.76 in recognition accuracy rate. Wrote part of the paper and won the third prize in the “Challenge Cup” National College Students Extracurricular Academic Science and Technology Competition
